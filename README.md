# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

This analysis will answer the folowing questions for investors regarding the proposed Citi Bike expansion in Des Moines, IA:
    1. What is the population of Des Moines? 
    2. How does its population compare to the population of New York City? 
    3. Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?

## Population Comparisons
The first storypoint is just a simple table that shows the total populations based on 2019 estimations from the US Census Bereau. New York City has a population of 8,336,817, while Des Moines has a much smaller estimated population of 214,237. Des Moines, however, does have a growth rate of roughly 5% over the last decade compared to NYC's 2%.

The second storypoint displays a line chart of ride length by age, and shows a clear inverse relationship between age, and the length of the ride. This means that a younger population is more likely to use Citi Bikes, and is therefore more profitable.

The third storypoint is a pie chart displaying that roughly 2/3 of Citi Bike riders are male. This suggests a population with more males is going to be more profitable for Citi Bikes.

The Fourth storypoint displays a table with the population breakdown of NYC and Des Moines. Des Moines has a higher percentage of persons under 65 (88.3% compared to NYC's 85.9%) and a higher percentage of males (49.2% compared to NYC's 47.7%) suggesting that the demographics of Des Moines are more adventageous for Citi Bike.

## Does total population matter?
The fifth storypoint displays a map showing the frequency of ride start points, most of which are centered around lower Manhattan, the most popular area for tourism in NYC. 

A City with a over 8 million residents is going to have more potential riders than a city with around two hundred-thousand, however, total population is not the only determining factor for riders. With a higher growth rate than NYC, more adventageous demographics than NYC and a growing tourism industry, Des Moines is a viable option for expansion for Citi Bike.
